In this project we will see how can we create reflective surfaces on modern OpenGL without the help of raytracing. To do so we will use a technique called cube mapping to map the environment to a texture. We will also see some other cool-effects we can achieve with cubemaps.

## Introduction to Cubemaps

A cubemap is basically a texture pack with six square layers, each layer is the projection of our environment with 6 different angles. These angles are representing a cube when it is loaded in a 3D environment. 

We can achieve same kind of environmental mapping with spheres, but it has problems such as distortion and computational inefficiency. 

The cubemaps can be created beforehand to represent some backgrounds in computer graphics applications. However, they also can be created in real-time to map the virtual environment to a texture to create effects like reflections. 

## Creating a Skybox

We can use real life equirectangular projection (panorama) images to create cubemaps. To do so we create a special mapping which calculates the spherical coordinates of the pixels on the cubemap. Then we take these spherical coordinates then lookup the related pixels using a interpolation method in the equirectangular projection images.

After that we can easily use this cubemap in our OpenGL programs to create skyboxes. Implementation is quite easy with the following steps.
- First, we create a cube mesh around our camera and make sure that cube doesn't move or rotate when our camere moves. This will give the effect of a far landscape.
- Then, we will make sure to render the cube with the cubemap texture which we loaded from a file using the 3D texture lookup functions in fragment shader. While rendering we should turn off the depth testing to make sure that the cubemap is always in the background.

In the end we will have a lovely background of a scene which we can easily look around.

## Dynamic Cubemaps for Reflections

The skyboxes are lovely, but how about reflections? The idea is simple, we just need to see the environment from the object's eyes. After that, we can easily look up and find the reflection to calculate the color on the surface of a object. To achieve real-time reflections we need a cubemap which is updated in each frame because there might be objects moving in our scene. 

This can be done using basic OpenGL functionalities. First we need to create a framebuffer, they are usefull for rendering off-screen just like in our case. Then, we set our camera's position into the objects position whose surface is reflective. After that it is simple, we render 6 times with 90 degrees viewing angle in each direction for our cube's faces and move these into our cubemap texture. While doing this we need to make sure that our reflective object is not in the scene to get the result without the inside of our object.

All there is left to do is sampling from the cubemap texture in our fragment shader of our object with a function called "reflect" which calculates the reflection of the direction between our camera and our point with a given surface normal.
