The geodesic distance is the distance between 2 points along the surface of the object. In the area of digital geometry processing, geodesic distances in 3D meshes helps us a lot in lots of fields because of it's properties like being invariant to different poses opposed to the euclidean distanecs. In this project we will examine the ways to find them and we will see the ways to use these distances, and we will focus on shape descriptor algorithms like iso-curve signature and bilateral maps.
